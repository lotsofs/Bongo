                   description="Probably need to establish some concrete rules for less vagueness. Here's some I can think of:
        
* If your game crashes after finishing an objective it will still count as completed and you don't have to redo.
* If your game crashes during an objective (eg. while collecting packages) you must start over. So if you collected 14 out of 20 packages, then crash, you must collect those 14 packages again, rather than just the remaining 6. (I think, people please confirm this rule) -- I agree
* Also you aren't allowed to reset the game to do objectives you lock yourself out (like mhmd did to do Drive Misty for me with a dodo), unless you reset your whole bingo card.

  <!-- Length:
0 = Can be done before An Old Friend and don't take too long (5-10 minutes max, roughly, with time spent driving to the objective not weighing as heavily. (Robberies will cost way less than the all robberies WR if properly routed within all the other objectives).
1 = Can either be done before An Old Friend, but take a while to complete (10+ minutes), or can be done fairly early on (~before guardian angels) and don't take too long (5-10 min), again not weighing driving time as heavily.
2 = Doable after Phnom Penh, and short. Or moderately long goals from the start. 
3 = Rub Out/Shakedown required, but after that not much time is needed. Or very long goals doable from the start.
4 = Rub Out/Shakedown required, and will take a while to complete. Or extremely long goals doable from the start.
5 = Pretty much a landmine, doing this on its own will take close to an hour, nevermind the other stuff.

Difficulty:
0 = Anyone who has ever completed a VC any% run/playthrough can do this without prior experience doing it
1 = Takes some game knowledge to execute well but not too hard
2 = Moderately hard but not frustratingly so
3 = Designed to be difficult, even 100% runners struggle with this -->
